melon slipping down our chins in rivulets of sticky red
storms that swept over steel clanging harsh melodic sweet brash
we were huddled under blankets ten to one sheet
stomachs growling always hungry 
donning masks of courage that cracked at cackling bursting brightness
and grinning in terrified silence
but we were free and then we crawled to safety
